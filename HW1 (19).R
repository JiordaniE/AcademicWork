#Task 1

#A delimiter is a character that seperates variables

#summary() acts differently with different objects because objects have different classes

#The difference between install.packages('package_name') and library(package_name) is that install.packages('package_name') installs a package that you named from CRAN and library(package_name) just enables the installed package

#A dataframe is 2 dimensional heterogenous data. A list can have a dataframe, but are 1 dimensional and have any r-object

#Task 2

#Read in yeast dataset using tidyverse

yeast <- read_csv('jretienn_yeast.csv')

#Summary of erl column

summary(yeast$erl)

#Mean is .502

#Create a character vector for cols

#Read in hepatits and assign column names
hepatitis <- read_tsv(('jretienn_hepatitis.tsv'), col_names = c('LIVER_BIG','HISTOLOGY', 'MALAISE', 'ASCITES', 'SPIDERS', 'AGE'))
